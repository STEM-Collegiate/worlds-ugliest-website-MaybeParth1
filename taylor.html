    <main>
    <p>Her music is so overrated. She keep talking about heartbreaks and her fans love it. But the second her and Travis Kelce got engaged, it was like her entire fanbase exploded. Her fans treat her as the best musical artist as if they haven't listened to anyone else their entire life. Her music gets so boring and repetitive as if it's a song on repeat.</p>
