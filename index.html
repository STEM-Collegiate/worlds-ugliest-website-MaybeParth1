        <h1>Worst Current Basketball team</h1>
        <p>The Boston Celtics are the worst team ever after Kyrie Irving left. They play like dogs chasing a bone, always running after the ball but they can never score. Honestly, Larry Bird at his current age could still play better than over half of the current Celtics team. The logo is also so ugly. It looks like it was drawn by someone who was 5 and somebody thought it was a good idea to use that image.</p>
