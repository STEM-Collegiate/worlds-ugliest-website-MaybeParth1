    <main> <p>Even if you arrive on time, you often end up sitting in the waiting room or exam room for much longer than expected. This really sucks if you have an appointment on a weekend too. Physicals, needles, or being asked personal questions about your health can feels really awkward. Sometimes you leave without clear answers, or you might be nervous about test results or a diagnosis. Imaging going to a doctor's appointment and he tells you that you need a blood test. Something like that would get anyone stressed.</p>
